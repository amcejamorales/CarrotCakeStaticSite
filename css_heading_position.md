# Changing the Position of the Heading

If you're used to word processing you might be tempted to change the position of the heading at the top of the page. It's also very common to see pages with centered titles so let's center our heading!

Recall the different components of a style block: the _selector_, the _property_, and the _value_. Our selector is `h1`, our property is `text-align`, and our value is `center`. Go ahead and add this to your `styles.css` page:

```
h1 {
  text-align: center;
}
```

> Challenge: look up how to change the background color of the entire page using CSS before moving on to the next section.
