# About HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## HTML
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is the primary way to put content on a webpage. Content mainly comes in two forms, text and media, and is further subdivided from there. HTML lets you indicate to a web browser what _kind_ of text and what _kind_ of media you're putting on the page. For example, text can come in the form of a header, a paragraph, or a list, while media could be in the form of an image, a video, or an audio file.

While some browsers could determine what kind of content you want to put on a page even with improper syntax, not all browsers can. It's best to use proper HTML syntax to label your content. In the end, that's what HTML is all about, semantic labeling. Writing HTML is about determining what you want to put on a page and then labeling it as such.

## CSS
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. As the name implies, it lets you style your webpage. You can use CSS to change the font style of your text, give your page a background color or background image, place borders around your paragraphs, etc. You could even play around with animations in CSS without writing JavaScript at all.

CSS also handles one very important component of web pages: formatting. Without CSS HTML almost entirely arranges elements vertically. Content flows from top to bottom. CSS enables you to place HTML elements wherever you'd like on the page or in relation to other HTML elements. Think of any website you use often. Chances are there are elements and even whole sections of the page that sit next to each other. Without CSS pages would not be this dynamic and the user experience would be quite dull.

## JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language that greatly expands what you can do on a webpage. It is primarily used to affect behavior on a webpage. For example, think of when you hover over a menu item in a navigation bar and a dropdown menu appears or when you type text into a search bar and some suggestions appear. JavaScript can be used for much, much more. These are only basic examples of the behavior you can put into your webpage.

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the primary building blocks of modern web development. It's important to understand what they each do, how they're different, and how they work with each other to build a seamless user experience. As much as you can, try to keep them separate -- a single file should not have HTML, CSS, and JS mixed in together.  

To recap:
> HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): puts **content** on the page via semantic labeling.

> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): **styles** the HTML elements on the page.

> JS (JavaScript): affects the behavior of the page and how a user interacts with the HTML elements.
