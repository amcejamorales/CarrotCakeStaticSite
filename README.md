# Introduction

This tutorial goes over building a simple, static, one-page website from scratch using HTML and CSS. The sample website contains paragraphs, headers, images, and lists, all common elements in most websites. In addition, it has custom font styles, colors, borders, and more.

## Prerequisites
This tutorial assumes you have access to a computer and can download a code editor from the Internet. I recommend Atom, which you can download [here](https://atom.io/). You'll use a code editor like Atom to write your HTML and CSS files. You'll also need a web browser to view your webpage as you code along in your editor.
