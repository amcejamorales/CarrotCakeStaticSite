# Adding a Heading
Now that you've added a few paragraphs let's add a heading to the top of our page so anyone reading it can know what it's about at a glance.

We'll need heading tags for this. You have six options to choose from; the _h1 tag_ is reserved for the main heading near the top of the page, the _h2 tag_ is for important sub-headings, _h3_ for less important sub-headings, etc. Let's add an _h1 tag_ to our page:
```
<h1>Carrot Cake Recipe</h1>
<p>Carrot cake is the best cake! Lorem ispum ...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
```
Keep in mind that elements are rendered sequentially, so if you put your heading element under your paragraph elements in `index.html`, it'll appear beneath your paragraphs in your browser.

> Challenge: Add a link in your page to any website you'd like. (Hint: look this up online. There's a ton of documentation on the Internet!)
